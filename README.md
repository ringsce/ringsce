RINGSCE is an open-source engine and mechanism for RPG and tabletop engines designed to work on macOS 11+ (Big Sur and newer). It is built on top of C++ and SwiftUI, with projects being developed using CMake. While RINGSCE is not intended to replace AppCode, it fills a niche in the development ecosystem and aims to cater to users' needs.

Currently, the IDE is actively being developed, with ongoing improvements and features being added regularly.
